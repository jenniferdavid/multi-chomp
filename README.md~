Trials with CHOMP
=================

You need [CMake][], [Eigen][] v3, and [GTK+][] v2.  Then everything is easy:

    git clone https://github.com/jenniferdavid/multi-chomp.git multi-chomp
    mkdir multi-chomp/build
    cd multi-chomp/build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./pp2d
    ./pprrr2d

As the name implies, this is based on [CHOMP][].
